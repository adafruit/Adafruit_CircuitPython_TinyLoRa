**WARNING: This library is not compatible with The Things Network v3 stack. Since TTN has fully migrated to v3, this library is not longer able to communicate with TTN.**


LoRaWAN/The Things Network V2, for CircuitPython.

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `Bus Device <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading `the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle>`_.

Installing from PyPI
====================

On supported GNU/Linux systems like the Raspberry Pi, you can install the driver locally `from
PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-circuitpython-tinylora/>`_. To install for current user:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-tinylora

To install system-wide (this may be required in some cases):

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-tinylora

To install in a virtual environment in your current project:

.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir project-name && cd project-name
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-tinylora

Usage Example

This library was written by ClemensRiederer. We've converted it to work with Adafruit CircuitPython and made
changes so it works with the Raspberry Pi and Adafruit Feather M0/M4. We've added examples for using this library
to transmit data and sensor data to The Things Network.
